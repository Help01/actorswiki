# What is ACTORS? 
ACTORS is a complete game framework with multiscene editing, game object pooling and ECS (entity-component-system) approach for game logic explicitly built for Unity3d.

It is used to ease the pain of decoupling data from behaviors without tons of boilerplate code and without unnecessary overhead.
