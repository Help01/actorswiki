The Actor is a bridge class that allows communicating between unity game objects and framework. Most of the time you will inherit from Actors when defining new objects.

The Actor class is *NOT* for defining game logic. You use Actors only to add some components to the entity, to have a connection between Framework and Unity out of the box and for initial setup of the object.
