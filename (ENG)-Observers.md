#  Reactive components
In the framework, you can _subscribe_ to the changing of a variable and perform an action at the time of the changing it.

### When you need it?
Basically it is convenient for working with the interfaces that often need to observe some parameters. For example, the health of the main character.

### How to subscribe?
#### The 1st way.
Using the method ```this.Value Change ()``` to create and return an abstract entity with an observer.
```csharp
	sealed class ProcessorTesting: Processor, ITick
	{

		public float hp;
		public ent observer;
		
		public ProcessorTesting()
		{
                        //where "source" = the object from which the variable is taken
			observer = this.ValueChange(source => hp, HandleChangeHP);
		}

                // The method that will work when the change occurred. Returns the changed value.
		void HandleChangeHP(float val) 
                {
                         Debug.Log($"HP IS {val}"); 
                }
          }

```
#### The 2nd way.
It is not necessary to create a new entity, you can connect the observer to an existing one. Sometimes it is convenient when we donâ€™t want to bother with the destruction of the observer, because it will be destroyed along with the entity of which we added it. 
```csharp
	sealed class ProcessorTesting: Processor, ITick
	{

		public float hp;
		public ent observer;
		
		public ProcessorTesting()
		{
                         // imagine that this is a player
                        observer = Entity.Create();
                        // where "source" = the object from which the variable is taken
			this.ValueChange(source => hp, HandleChangeHP, observer);
		}

                // The method that will work when the change occurred. Returns the changed value.
		void HandleChangeHP(float val) 
                {
                         Debug.Log($"HP IS {val}"); 
                }
          }

```
> Note,  
You can connect more than one observer to an entity. To do this, it is enough to continue to transfer the same entity to the method -```this.Value Change ()```.

### How to unsubscribe?
Because of observers depend on entities, they will automatically be destroyed along with the entities.
The method ```this.ValueChange()```returns a new entity with an observer and cashed it, you can call it using the method ```Release```

```csharp
        public ent observer;
	public void Tick(float delta)
		{
			if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.A))
			{
				observer.Release();
			}
		}
```
If you just need to clear the stack of the observers of the entity without destroying it, you can use
```observer.ReleaseObservers();```
```csharp
        public ent observer;
	public void Tick(float delta)
		{
			if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.A))
			{
				observer.ReleaseObservers();
			}
		}
```
