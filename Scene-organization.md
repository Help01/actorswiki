## Multiple Scenes
The framework is based on [Multi-Scene editing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MultiSceneEditing.html).

There are two variants of scenes:
* Main
* Secondary

The main scenes are all the scenes in which the component “Starter” or the component inherited from “Starter” will be present.

Each of the main scenes always has the following structure:

* [SETUP] – The “Starter” component is added to this object, it is allowed to use SETUP for other components of settings.
* [SCENE] is the “root” of the main scene.
  * Dynamic - all created GO (GameObject) will be loaded here during the game session.

All the scenes of the framework by default do not contain a camera as it is supposed to use a separate scene with a camera.

## Starter

Starter is an essential component. When the scenes are loaded or changed, The "Starter" component is processed first. Its functions include the initialization of handlers for the current level, the management of additional scenes at the start. The starter is responsible for which scenes can remain after the main scene is closed.

Any starter serves as a single entry point into the program (level) - all the components inherited from Actor or Monocached will be initialized after the starters.
