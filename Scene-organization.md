##The framework is based on multiscenes.

There are two variants of scenes:
*Main
*Secondary

The main scenes are all the scenes in which the component “Starter” or the component inherited from “Starter” will be present.

Any main scene always has the following structure:

[SETUP] – The “Starter” component is added to this object, it is allowed to use SETUP for other components of settings.
[SCENE] is the “root” of the level.
Dynamic - all created GO (GameObject) will be loaded here during the game session.
Scenes by default do not contain a camera as it is supposed to use a separate scene with a camera.
